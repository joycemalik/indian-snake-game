# Cursor Snake - Apple Collector (Updated)

This is a simple JavaScript canvas game where you control a snake-like cursor to collect apples, while an AI snake also tries to navigate the screen. The game features smooth snake movement, screen wrap-around, and increasing difficulty over time.

## Features:
*   **Player-controlled Snake:** Follows your mouse cursor.
*   **AI-controlled Snake:** Navigates independently, following random targets.
*   **Apple Collection:** Collect apples to increase your score and grow your snake.
*   **Dynamic Speed:** Game speed gradually increases over time.
*   **Screen Wrap-around:** Both snakes and apples seamlessly move from one edge of the screen to the opposite.
*   **Responsive Design:** Canvas resizes to fill the browser window.
*   **Updated Apple Logo:** Incorporates a custom "Google apple" image for the apples.

## How to Play:
1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Move your mouse to control the green player snake.
3.  Collect the apple (new custom logo) to score points and make your snake grow longer.
4.  Avoid the red AI snake (currently no collision detection for losing, but adds visual dynamics).

## Development:
The game is built using pure JavaScript and HTML Canvas API.
